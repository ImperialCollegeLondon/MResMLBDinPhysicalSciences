# Machine Learning and Big Data in the Physical Sciences - Pre-course Material

This is the pre-course material for the Machine Learning and Big Data in the Physical Sciences MRes at Imperial College.

Python is used extensively for machine learning and analysis of large datasets both in scientific research and industry! Whether you're familiar with python or not, we strongly recommend that you review the following python tutorials so that you're comfortable with
progamming in python before you start the course. Doing so will help you prepare for starting the course in October and to acheive more during your time at Imperial. 


## Jupyter notebooks 

All of the exercises in the pre-course materials are written in jupyter notebooks. These allow you to try out python for yourself, without needing to download anything to your laptop. You can try out any of the notebooks by clicking this button -> [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/ImperialCollegeLondon/MResMLBDinPhysicalSciences/main). 

Clicking that button will open a web browser, in which you can run the jupyter notebooks (the files ending in `.ipynb`). Note that it might take a few minutes to setup the environment for you. 

## Basic python

First, take a look at the [PreCourse/Python/Basic_Python](https://github.com/ImperialCollegeLondon/MResMLBDinPhysicalSciences/blob/main/PreCourse/Python/Basic_Python.pdf) slides to learn about basic programming in python. There are four jupyter notebooks `basic_python.ipynb`, `classes.ipynb`, `exceptions.ipynb` and `lambdas.ipynb`  that will teach you about some of basic features of python that you will use during the course. 

## Scientific python

While python is a simple and easy to learn programming language, the many scientific libraries available for python make it extremely powerful for machine learning and data science. Take a look through the [PreCourse/Python/Scientific_Python](https://github.com/ImperialCollegeLondon/MResMLBDinPhysicalSciences/blob/main/PreCourse/Python/Scientific_Python.pdf) slides to learn about  `numpy` and `scipy`. 

**ADVANCED** If you're feeling like a bit of a challenge, you can also try out some of the exercises in the `Worksheet.ipynb` jupyter notebook to get to grips with these packages. There may be some concepts you aren't familiar with required for these exercises so don't worry if you can't solve them just yet!
 

## Statistics in python 

We use python a lot in statistical analyses of data. There `scipy.stats` package is very useful for dealing with random variables and probability distributions. Have a look at the [PreCourse/Statistics/StatisticsInPython](https://github.com/ImperialCollegeLondon/MResMLBDinPhysicalSciences/blob/main/PreCourse/Statistics/StatisticsInPython.pdf) slides (and `StatisticsInPython.ipynb` jupyter notebook) to see some basic statistics with python. 

# Other material for you to prepare for your MRes 

We strongly reccomend you to take a look at additional courses / material below to brush up (or learn) the skills you'll need for the MRes. Some of this will be covered again during your taught courses but having seen some of it in advance will definitely help!

## Graduate School skills courses 

Once you have fully enrolled at Imperial,  you will have access to many courses on Research practices, skills and scientific writing from the Graduate School. You will find out more about these courses at the start of the MRes programme, but you can already take a look at the material available if you want to dig a bit deeper into courses related to the MLBD MRes. You can find all of the courses on the [Graduate School]([https://www.imperial.ac.uk/study/pg/graduate-school/students/masters/](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/students/academic-support/graduate-school/)) web pages.

Specifically, the following courses will be very beneficial before you start the MLBD MRes and during your first term at the College:

### Introduction to Python 
   * If you find that you are not comfortable with the level of python contained in the Pre-course material above, you should register for the [Introduction to Python](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/students/academic-support/graduate-school/students/masters/professional-development/introduction-to-python-online-course/) online course available from the Graduate school. We reccomend doing so as soon as possible. 
   
### Computing and data science 
   * [Linux command-line for scientific computing](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/students/academic-support/graduate-school/students/doctoral/professional-development/research-computing-data-science/courses/linux-command-line-for-scientific-computing/)
   * [Plotting in python with matplotlib](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/students/academic-support/graduate-school/students/doctoral/professional-development/research-computing-data-science/courses/plotting-in-python-with-matplotlib/)
   * [Data Exploration and Visualisation](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/students/academic-support/graduate-school/students/doctoral/professional-development/research-computing-data-science/courses/data-exploration-visualisation/)
   * [Introduction to Sampling & Hypothesis Testing](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/students/academic-support/graduate-school/students/doctoral/professional-development/research-computing-data-science/courses/sampling-hypothesis-testing/)

### Scientific writing & presentation skills 
   * [Introduction to Latex](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/students/academic-support/graduate-school/students/doctoral/professional-development/research-computing-data-science/courses/introduction-to-latex/)
   * [Preparing your literature review](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/students/academic-support/graduate-school/students/masters/professional-development/preparing-your-literature-review-online-course/)
   * [Preparing your dissertation](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/students/academic-support/graduate-school/students/masters/professional-development/preparing-your-dissertation-online-course/)

### Compulsory modules 
   * [Plagiarism awareness](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/students/academic-support/graduate-school/students/masters/professional-development/plagiarism-online/) - This is a compulsory module that you must take as early as possible during the course! Failure to complete this course can result in being unable to complete the MRes. 

## Mathematics for Statistics and Machine Learning

While the MRes is focused on the practical application of machine learning and statistics for data analysis, we can't avoid doing some mathematics. Whether you don't have a very maths based background or you feel a bit rusty on your maths, you should  brush up in these areas before you start the course. Imperial College runs an online course on coursera which we highly reccomend for you "Mathematics for Machine Learning Specialization": https://www.coursera.org/specializations/mathematics-machine-learning

Once you have your Imperial College ID, you will be able to access the course and we recommend you take Course 1 and Course 2 from Mathematics for Machine Learning Specialization. 

The main mathematics areas to brush up on are those typically taught in undergraduate STEM courses; 
   * Linear algebra (matrix multiplication and eigenvalues/eigenvectors) 
   * Basic calculus (differentiation, chain rule, integration)
   * Ordinay differential equations 

These subjects will be covered in the above coursera course but some revision in these over the summer will help.
