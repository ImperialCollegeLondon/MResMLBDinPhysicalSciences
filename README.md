# Machine Learning and Big Data in the Physical Sciences

This is the pre-course material for the Machine Learning and Big Data in the Physical Sciences MRes at Imperial College.

Whether you're familiar with python or not, we recommend you to go through the following python tutorials so that you're comfortable with
progamming in python before you start the course.

## Jupyter notebooks 

All of the exercises in the pre-course materials are written in jupyter notebooks. These allow you to try out python for yourself, without needing to download anything to your laptop. You can try out any of the notebooks by clicking this button -> [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/ImperialCollegeLondon/MResMLBDinPhysicalSciences/HEAD). 

Clicking that button will open a web browser, in which you can run the jupyter notebooks (the files ending in `.ipynb`). Note that it might take a few minutes to setup the environment for you. 

## Basic python

First, take a look at the [PreCourse/Python/Basic_Python](https://github.com/ImperialCollegeLondon/MResMLBDinPhysicalSciences/blob/main/PreCourse/Python/Basic_Python.pdf) slides to learn about basic programming in python. There are four jupyter notebooks `basic_python.ipynb`, `classes.ipynb`, `exceptions.ipynb` and `lambdas.ipynb`  that will teach you about some of basic features of python that you will use during the course. 

## Scientific python

While python is a simple and easy to learn programming language, the many scientific libraries available for python make it extremely powerful for machine learning and data science. Take a look through the [PreCourse/Python/Scientific_Python](https://github.com/ImperialCollegeLondon/MResMLBDinPhysicalSciences/blob/main/PreCourse/Python/Scientific_Python.pdf) slides to learn about  `numpy` and `scipy`. You can also try out some of the exercises in the `Worksheet.ipynb` jupyter notebook to get to grips with these packages. 

## Statistics in python 

We use python a lot in statistical analyses of data. There `scipy.stats` package is very useful for dealing with random variables and probability distributions. Have a look at the [PreCourse/Statistics/StatisticsInPython](https://github.com/ImperialCollegeLondon/MResMLBDinPhysicalSciences/blob/main/PreCourse/Statistics/StatisticsInPython.pdf) slides (and `StatisticsInPython.ipynb` jupyter notebook) to see some basic statistics with python.
